The use of a base class pointer (like `Shape*`) is crucial for achieving **polymorphism**, which enables **flexible and reusable code**. Why this is valuable and not just redundant?

### Why Use a Base Class Pointer?
1. **Dynamic Dispatch (Runtime Behavior):**  
   The type of the object being pointed to (`Circle` or `Rectangle`) is determined at runtime, not at compile time. This is useful when the program doesn’t know in advance what type of shape it will handle.

   Example:  
   ```cpp
   Shape* shapePtr;
   if (userChoosesCircle) {
       shapePtr = new Circle(5.0);
   } else {
       shapePtr = new Rectangle(4.0, 6.0);
   }
   cout << "Area: " << shapePtr->area() << endl;
   ```

   Without a base class pointer, you would have to write separate code for every shape type, which is less flexible.

2. **Code Generalization (Polymorphic Containers):**  
   You can use a single container (e.g., `std::vector<Shape*>`) to store objects of different derived types and process them uniformly.

   Example:  
   ```cpp
   vector<Shape*> shapes;
   shapes.push_back(new Circle(5.0));
   shapes.push_back(new Rectangle(4.0, 6.0));

   for (Shape* shape : shapes) {
       cout << "Area: " << shape->area() << endl;
   }
   ```

   Here, without `Shape*`, you couldn't store both `Circle` and `Rectangle` in the same container.

---

3. **Extensibility:**  
   If new shapes (e.g., `Triangle`) are added, the existing code doesn’t need modification. You simply define the `area()` for the new shape, and the program works seamlessly with the base class pointers.

---

### Why Not Just `myCircle.area()`?
Calling `myCircle.area()` works fine for specific, isolated instances, but:
- It doesn’t allow dynamic behavior.
- You lose the ability to work with heterogeneous collections of shapes.
- Your code becomes less scalable and harder to maintain.

### Key Takeaway:
Using a base class pointer like `Shape*` is essential for designing flexible, reusable, and scalable code, especially in applications that involve a variety of related types (e.g., shapes, animals, UI components). This is the true power of **polymorphism** in C++.
